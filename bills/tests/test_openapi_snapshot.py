"""The API contract, pinned.

``bills/tests/snapshots/openapi.json`` is the django-ninja schema as it was before phase C8 of
docs/modernisation/modernisation_plan.md (in the Minty repo). Any change to a route, a payload field or an
enum value shows up here as a readable diff instead of as a broken page in billing-frontend.

When a change is intended, regenerate with

    UPDATE_OPENAPI_SNAPSHOT=1 pytest bills/tests/test_openapi_snapshot.py

and commit the new snapshot together with the frontend change that consumes it.
